I"A<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>The mission of Denver’s Regional Transportation District (RTD) is to <strong>provide convenient bus and rail service to the Denver Metro Area</strong>. RTD operates more than 170 bus routes, 12 rail lines, and specialty services like Park-N-Ride for commuters, Access-A-Ride for disabled rides, and the free 16th Street Mall Ride. According to the 2019 Board of Directors Report, RTD’s <a href="https://www.rtd-denver.com/sites/default/files/files/2020-01/Q3-2019-KPIs.pdf">2019Q3 KPI for local on-time performance was 86%</a></p>

<p>As someone who recently transitioned from a personally owned vehicle to more sustainable forms of transportation, I would like to investigate whether or not they are still meeting this goal and what lines/routes have a higher or lower on-time performance than the entire system as whole. My hypotheses will be:</p>

\[\large H_0 \text{: RTD's Local On-Time Service &gt;= 86%}\]

\[\large H_A \text{: RTD's Local On-TIme Service &lt; 86%}\]
