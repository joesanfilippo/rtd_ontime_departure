        <h2>What is this?</h2>
        <p>
          This is a map of every property that is owned by a landlord. I have
          defined a landlord as someone who owns more than 1 property or has LLC
          or Trust in the name of the owner. This map should help illustrate how
          much property in Denver is owned as "an investment".

          properties that person owns.

        <h3>How can I verify this information?</h3>

        <h3>Things of Note</h3>
        <p>Since this list is compiled by owner, there are owners that some
          people may not typically consider landlords. Owners like the "CITY &
          COUNTY OF DENVER" or "SCHOOL DISTRICT NO 1". I left those in the
          data set because I didn't want to accidentally remove one that
          sounds like it is a government entity when really it is a private
          entity.</p>

        <h3>Mile High View</h3>
        <p>
          02/18/2021: After a first pass it appears that between 25% - 33% of
          home on any given block in Denver are rentals. Which would mean that 1
          out of every 3 or 4 Denverites are renters

        <h3>Why did you make this?</h3>
        <p>
          My partner and I are trying to buy a home in Denver. We have been
          planning and saving for a few years and we recently started actively
          searching for what we hope to be our forever home. We watched as house
          after house was purchased significantly above list price and we
          wondered who could be buying these homes? I was interested in learning
          how many properties in Denver were owned by people with multiple
          properties so I figured this would be a neat project. I had an inkling
          that might be who we would be competing with but I was surprised at
          how pervasive landlord and investor owned properties are.
